class HPe3631a(PowerSupply, PowerSupply.Channel, SCPIInstrument):

    """
    The HPe3631a is a three channels voltage/current supply.
    - Channel 1 is a positive +6V/5A channel (P6V)
    - Channel 2 is a positive +25V/1A channel (P25V)
    - Channel 3 is a negative -25V/1A channel (N25V)

    This module is designed for the power supply to be set to
    a specific channel and remain set afterwards as this device
    does not offer commands to set or read multiple channels
    without calling the channel set command each time (0.5s). It is
    possible to call a specific channel through psu.channel[idx],
    which will automatically reset the channel id, when necessary.

    This module is likely to work as is for the Agilent E3631 and
    Keysight E3631 which seem to be rebranded but identical devices.

    Example usage:

    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> psu = ik.hp.HPe3631a.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 10)
    >>> psu.channelid = 2           # Sets channel to P25V
    >>> psu.voltage = 12.5          # Sets voltage to 12.5V
    >>> psu.voltage                 # Reads back set voltage
    array(12.5) * V
    >>> psu.voltage_sense           # Reads back sensed voltage
    array(12.501) * V
