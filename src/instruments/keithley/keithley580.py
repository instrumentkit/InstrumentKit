        lead and offset resistances or to store an input as a reference level.

        The two types are continuous and one-shot. Continuous has the instrument
        continuously sample the resistance. One-shot performs a single
        resistance measurement.

        The three trigger sources are on talk, on GET, and on "X". On talk
        refers to addressing the instrument to talk over GPIB. On GET is when
        the instrument receives the GPIB command byte for "group execute
        trigger". Last, on "X" is when one sends the ASCII character "X" to the
        instrument. This character is used as a general execute to confirm
        commands send to the instrument. In InstrumentKit, "X" is sent after
        each command so it is not suggested that one uses on "X" triggering.
