    Given an instrument class, expected output from the host and expected input
    from the instrument, asserts that the protocol in a context block proceeds
    according to that expectation.
    
    For an example of how to write tests using this context manager, see
    the ``make_name_test`` function below.

    :param type ins_class: Instrument class to use for the protocol assertion.
    :param host_to_ins: Data to be sent by the host to the instrument;
        this is checked against the actual data sent by the instrument class
        during the execution of this context manager.

        concatenated with the separator given by ``sep``.
    :param ins_to_host: Data to be sent by the instrument; this is played
        back during the execution of this context manager, and should
        be used to assert correct behaviour within the context.

        concatenated with the separator given by ``sep``.
