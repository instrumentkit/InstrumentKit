class HP6652a(PowerSupply, PowerSupply.Channel):

    """
    The HP6652a is a single output power supply.

    Because it is a single channel output, this object inherits from both
    PowerSupply and PowerSupply.Channel.

    According to the manual, this class MIGHT be usable for any HP power supply
    with a model number HP66XYA, where X is in {4,5,7,8,9} and Y is a digit(?).
    (e.g. HP6652A and HP6671A)

    HOWEVER, it has only been tested by the author with an HP6652A power supply.

    Example usage:

    >>> import time
    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> psu = ik.hp.HP6652a.open_serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600)
    >>> psu.voltage = 3 # Sets output voltage to 3V.
    >>> psu.output = True
    >>> psu.voltage
    array(3.0) * V
    >>> psu.voltage_sense < 5
    True
    >>> psu.output = False
    >>> psu.voltage_sense < 1
    True
    >>> psu.display_textmode=True
    >>> psu.display_text("test GOOD")
    'TEST GOOD'
    >>> time.sleep(5)
    >>> psu.display_textmode=False
