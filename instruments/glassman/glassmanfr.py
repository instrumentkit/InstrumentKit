class GlassmanFR(PowerSupply, PowerSupply.Channel):

    """
    The GlassmanFR is a single output power supply.

    Because it is a single channel output, this object inherits from both
    PowerSupply and PowerSupply.Channel.

    This class should work for any of the Glassman FR Series power supplies
    and is also likely to work for the EJ, ET, EY and FJ Series which seem
    to share their communication protocols. The code has only been tested
    by the author with an Glassman FR50R6 power supply.

    Before this power supply can be remotely operated, remote communication
    must be enabled and the HV must be on. Please refer to the manual.

    Example usage:

    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> psu = ik.glassman.GlassmanFR.open_serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)
    >>> psu.voltage = 100 # Sets output voltage to 100V.
    >>> psu.voltage
    array(100.0) * V
    >>> psu.output = True # Turns on the power supply
    >>> psu.voltage_sense < 200 * u.volt
    True

    This code uses default values of `voltage_max`, `current_max` and
    `polarity` that are only valid of the FR50R6 in its positive setting.
    If your power supply differs, reset those values by calling:

    >>> import instruments.units as u
    >>> psu.voltage_max = 40.0 * u.kilovolt
    >>> psu.current_max = 7.5 * u.milliamp
    >>> psu.polarity = -1
