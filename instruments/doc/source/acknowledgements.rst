Here I've done my best to keep a list of all those who have made a contribution
to this project. All names listed below are the Github account names associated
with their commits.

First off, I'd like to give special thanks to cgranade for his help with pretty
much every step along the way. I would be hard pressed to find something that he
had nothing to do with.

- ihincks for the fantastic property factories (used throughout all classes) and for the Tektronix DPO70000 series class. 
- dijkstrw for contributing several classes (HP6632b, HP3456a, Keithley 580) as well as plenty of general IK testing.
- CatherineH for the Qubitekk CC1, Thorlabs LCC25, and Thorlabs SC10 classes
- silverchris for the TekTDS5xx class
- wil-langford for the HP6652a class
- whitewhim2718 for the Newport ESP 301
