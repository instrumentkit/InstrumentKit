    """
    The Keithley Model 485 is a 4 1/2 digit resolution autoranging
    picoammeter with a +- 20000 count LCD. It is designed for low
    current measurement requirements from 0.1pA to 2mA.

    The device needs some processing time (manual reports 300-500ms) after a
    command has been transmitted.

    Example usage:

    >>> import instruments as ik
    >>> inst = ik.keithley.Keithley485.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 22)
    >>> inst.measure()  # Measures the current
    array(-1.278e-10) * A

        readings. The purpose of making relative measurements is to cancel test
        lead and offset currents or to store an input as a reference level.

        relative level is set. The relative value is only good for the range the

        There are two different trigger settings for three different sources.
        This means there are six different settings for the trigger mode.

        The two types are continuous and one-shot. Continuous has the instrument
        continuously sample the current. One-shot performs a single
        current measurement when requested to do so.

        The three trigger sources are on talk, on GET, and on "X". On talk
        refers to addressing the instrument to talk over GPIB. On GET is when
        the instrument receives the GPIB command byte for "group execute
        trigger". Last, on "X" is when one sends the ASCII character "X" to the
        instrument.

        It is recommended to leave it in the default mode (T0, continuous on talk),
        and simply ignore the output when other commands are called.
