        readings. The purpose of making relative measurements is to cancel test
        lead and offset currents or to store an input as a reference level.

        relative level is set. The relative value is only good for the range the
        value was taken on and higher ranges. If a lower range is selected than
        that on which the relative was taken, inaccurate results may occur.

        There are two different trigger settings for three different sources.
        This means there are six different settings for the trigger mode.

        The two types are continuous and one-shot. Continuous has the instrument
        continuously sample the current. One-shot performs a single
        current measurement.

        The three trigger sources are on talk, on GET, and on "X". On talk
        refers to addressing the instrument to talk over GPIB. On GET is when
        the instrument receives the GPIB command byte for "group execute
        trigger". Last, on "X" is when one sends the ASCII character "X" to the
        instrument. This character is used as a general execute to confirm
        commands send to the instrument. In InstrumentKit, "X" is sent after
        each command so it is not suggested that one uses on "X" triggering.

        It is recommended to leave it in the default mode (T0, continuous on talk),
        and simply ignore the output when other commands are called.
