"""
Cryomagnetics is interesting when it comes to serial communication.
Cryomagnetics devices will echo the command sent to the device, followed by
``\\r\\n``, followed by the response, followed by another ``\\r\\n``.
Consequently, the vanilla serial communicator needs to be subclassed in order
to allow proper serial communication to happen
